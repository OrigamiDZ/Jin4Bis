ReadMe of the repositary JIN4
"Project realised in two weeks in order to test us on the C++ course we were introduced to. 
This game is based on SFML and Photon Engine.

The game is based on the 9 muses of the Greek mythology, each having a cultural subject. 
The player has to answer to cultural questions, on the subjects of the 9 muses. 
The player can play solo or against an opponent.

Unfortunately, the architecture of this game wasn't adapted for a multiplayer usage. 
The game was redone, see the JIN4-Bis repository https://github.com/OrigamiDZ/Jin4Bis"

The project and especially the architecture was completely redone (still in two weeks), the multiplayer functionality works now.
It was designed so two people could play at the same time, not for an online usage.
